# DisPlex Project

Displex is a program I built in my spare time which the source code can be found on my github [mchestr/displex](https://github.com/mchestr/displex). Displex is a discord bot + other stuff which I use to automate managing some of my Plex media and users.

## Features

- Web Server: implement OAuth2 flows and Dicord Linked Role. Users can be assigned a role in discord if they are invited to my Plex server.
- Discord Bot: Doesn't do anything but respond to `~ping` commands.
- Script to update Discord user metadata to display how many hours the user has streamed.
- Script to cleanup expired discord tokens
- Script to automatically increase user request limits on Overseerr as they watch more Plex
- And whatever else I add
