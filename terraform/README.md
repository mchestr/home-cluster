# Terraform Setup

This project uses [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/) to store the `tfstate` of the app, following patterns established by the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home) community.

## Getting Started

To initialize Terraform Cloud, run the following command in each module:

```bash
terraform init
```
